# Biography

I am a PhD Candidate in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) at the University of California Berkeley. My advisor is Professor  [Shmuel Oren](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~oren/). I completed my undergraduate studies in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece, where I worked with Professor [Stavros Papathanasiou](http://users.ntua.gr/stpapath/index_en.htm).

I am an external collaborator of the [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/). My research is also partly supported by the [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute](https://tbsi.berkeley.edu/home), Lab 1C (Smart Grid and Renewable Energy). I have also worked for Amazon.com and for the [Calibration Service](https://www.haf.gr/en/structure/hafsc/calibration-service/) of the Hellenic Air Force.

My research interests lie in the field of large scale optimization for power systems. Specifically, I am interested in developing techniques for modeling and solving mixed integer programs for power systems applications, such as the stochastic unit commitment problem and the power system restoration problem.
I have also worked on model predictive control for electric drives and modeling and control for wind turbines and HVDC systems. 

I have collaborated with [Deepak Rajan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SUdiz2AAAAAJ&hl=en), [Ignacio Aravena](https://sites.google.com/site/iaravenasolis/home), [Petros Karamanakos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=70EUJnQAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Sotirios Nanou](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=3OHbnFAAAAAJ&hl=el).

I am a fellow of the Onassis Foundation and recepient of the 2013 Chrysovergis Award and the 2013 ECE Kontaxis Award at NTUA.
