# Biography

I am a PhD Candidate in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) at UC Berkeley, California, USA. My advisor is Professor Shmuel S. Oren. I completed my undergraduate studies in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece, in 2013, where I worked with Professor Stavros Papathanassiou.

I am an external collaborator of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In the past, I have worked for the Calibration Service of the Hellenic Air Force.

My current research interests lie in the field of Optimization for Power Systems. More specifically, I am interested in developing techniques for modeling and solving large scale Mixed Integer Programs for Power Systems applications, such as the Stochastic Unit Commitment problem and the Power System Restoration problem.

I have also worked on model predictive control for electric drives and modeling and control for wind turbines and HVDC systems. I have collaborated with Dr. Deepak Rajan, Ignacio Aravena, Associate Professor Petros Karamanakos, and Dr. Sotirios Nanou.

I am a fellow of the Onassis Foundation and recepient of the 2013 Chrysovergis Award and the 2013 ECE Kontaxis Award at NTUA.
